# Project:

Idea was to create motorcycle e-store. Project consists of two blocks (BackEnd and FrontEnd). All data base data is stored in BackEnd folder data (.json + img). I used Mongodb Compass to import .json and worked with it.

Generally I spent most of my time to disassemble project that we made in class and then I assembled those pieces that were required in my project. I spent first week to try understand why and how it all works, but still there are some parts that I do not understand to full extent (need time to read on it). On second week I tried my best to add new functionality and that also took great peace of time for reading, and learning (still much to do).

# Known errors that I could not fix because (lack of time and knowledge):

1.	Error Handler does not catch wrong login input –> browser does not respond for some time.
2.	Can not get username in comment to show –> username – undefined.

# Parts that I did not manage to finish:

1.	Cart (in process).
2.	Categories.

# My feelings:

It was hard and it was overwhelming. Almost every day ended with heavy head and feeling that I do not know anything and I must learn, learn, learn more.. But anyway I think it was good, because we did not consume all the knowledge from your hand, you gave us basics, directions, time and opportunity to learn by our self, and I think that was good decision. Only there is this feeling that there was so much information, that all what I tried to understand in beginning started to fade away because of the new information acquired every next day, so it means I need to return and go through again and again. My brain is tangled.

My project is not finished / finalized, but I intend to work on it also on next week (for myself and new knowledge).

Despite the decision will I or will I not get in Accenture, thank you for this opportunity to participate in bootcamp and have this experience.
